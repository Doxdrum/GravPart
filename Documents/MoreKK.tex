\chapter{More Advanced \KK Reduction}

In the previous chapter, it was seen that the \KK reduction of a scalar field on a total spacetime, which is a direct product of a $D$-dimensional spacetime and a compact manifold, is done with ease, but the moral of the procedure is that the effective mass is inversely proportional to the typical length, {\it a.k.a.} radius, of the compact manifold.

Therefore, if there is a phenomenological argument to assume that the compact manifold has a typical radius $R\lll \SI{e-2}{\TeV}$, then only the massless modes of the effective theory are worth tho be analysed. Thus, it is necessary to learn how to count the number of massless fields on the lower dimensional theory. The task is achieved by using topological information of the compact manifold.

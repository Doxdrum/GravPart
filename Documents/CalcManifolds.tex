\section{What is a Manifold?}

A $m$-dimensional {\sc Manifold} is a (topological) space which at each point looks locally like $\R^m$. Note that $m$ is a fixed number, and defines the dimension of the manifold.

\begin{Def}[Manifold]
  A {\sc Manifold}, $M$, is a topological space homeomorphic to $\R^m$.
\end{Def}



Examples of manifolds are  the body of a cylinder,  the spheres ($S^m$), the torus ($T^m$).

More illustrative is an example of a non-manifold, such as the body of a cone. A cone is not a manifold because the neighbourhood of the apex looks not line $\R^2$.

\section{Geometrical Objects on Manifolds}

The trick to define geometrical objects on  manifolds, $M$, is to find a way to assign an analog to the object defined on $\R^m$. This is achieved by the following procedure:
\begin{itemize}
\item Given a manifold $M$, set a point $p\in M$ and consider the neighbourhood, $U$, of $p$. The point is represented in the figure below by a black dot, while the neighbourhood $U$ is limited by a dotted circle around $p$.
\item For each choice of $U$, one can find a map from $M$ to $\R^m$, $\varphi:M\to \R^m$, called a chart on $U$.
\item Then, the $\varphi$ map helps to associate equivalent geometrical quantities on $M$ to those on $\R^m$.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \input{Pict/tikz-manifold.tex}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

From the procedure described, one can guess that a scalar field on $M$ is an assignment of a scalar to every point $p\in M$. The only non-trivial consideration is that the assignation must be consistent, i.e., the scalar should be independent of the chart one choose to map $M$ to $\R^m$. On $S^1$, the ``consistency'' condition is that one you go all around the sphere, the number you get must be the same that the one you begun with.

\subsection{Vectors}

On Euclidean geometry, one defines the ``velocity'' vector as the derivative of the position with respect to the time. This definition can be generalised to every curve, $c$, of a parameter $t$ over the Euclidean space, i.e., $c:\R\to\R^m$ defined by $c: t\to c(t)$.

Moreover, the space the function is mapped to could be a manifold instead of $\R^m$. Therefore, a curve on $M$ is a (continuous) map $c:\R\to M$. This is represented in the figure by the {\color{red} red map}, and its image is the {\color{red} red dotted line}.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \input{Pict/tikz-manifold.tex}
    \draw (1,-3) node[anchor=east] {$\R$} -- (5,-3);
    \draw[very thick, red,->] (3,-2.8) .. controls +(100:1cm) and (1.9,-2.5).. node[anchor=west,near start] {$c(t)$} (2,-1.3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Consider a map $f:M\to \R$, and restrict the domain of $f$ to the points $c(t)\in M$. Then the derivative of $f$ yields
\begin{align}
  f'\(c(t)\)&= \pder{f}{x^\mu}\pder{x^\mu}{t}\notag\\
  &= X[f],
\end{align}
where $X$ is the object one would like to call a {\bf vector} on $M$, and is defined through
\begin{align}
  X\equiv X^\mu \pder{}{x^\mu}= \pder{x^\mu}{t}\pder{}{x^\mu},\label{def-vector}
\end{align}
and $x^\mu$ are the coordinated of the point $p$ given by the function $c(t)$.
The quantities $X^\mu$ are the components of the vector, while $\pder{}{x^\mu}\equiv \pa{\mu}$ are the basis of the vector.

Note that the definition of the vector $X$ through Eq. \eqref{def-vector}, is independent of the function $f$, thus is a well-defines quantity. Additionally, the definition could be done with an arbitrary coordinate system $y^\mu = \Lambda^\mu{}_\nu x^\nu$, and the definition would give the same. Therefore, the components of the vector transforms as the coordinate, while the basis transform with the inverse transformation,
\begin{align}
  \pder{}{y^\mu} &= \(\Lambda^{-1}\)_\mu{}^\nu\pder{}{x^\nu},\\
  {X'}^\mu &= \Lambda^\mu{}_\nu X^\nu.
\end{align}

From the definition, one expect that the vectors  lie on a tangent space to the point $p$, this space is denoted by $T_p M$. When the manifold is not flat, the tangent spaces  at $p$ and at $q$ are not necessary the same, thus, when one want to specify a vector a total of $2m$ coordinates are needed, $m$ of them to denote the point $p\in M$ and the other $m$ to denote the vector on $T_p M$.

Therefore, in order to define vector fields on $M$, the natural structure to consider is the disjoint union of all the tangent spaces. This structure is call the {\bf tangent bundle}, $TM$, and mathematically is defined as
\begin{align}
  TM = \coprod_{p\in M}T_p M.
\end{align}
From the above arguments, it is clear that $\dim(TM)=2m$.


\subsection{One-Forms}

Given a vector $V\in T_p M$, one might define a linear application $\omega:T_p M\to \R$, in a way that
\begin{align}
  V[f] = V^\mu\pa{\mu}f\equiv \bk{\df\;f}{V}\in \R.
\end{align}
Above, bracket $\bk{\bullet}{\bullet}$ denotes the inner product, and $\df\,f$ is a {\bf 1-form}, i.e., linear application from a vector into the reals.

The 1-form $\df\,f$ can be expanded in components,
\begin{align}
  \df\,f=\pder{f}{x^\mu}\de{x^\mu},
\end{align}
with basis of the dual vector space $\de{x^\mu}$. The basis of the dual space can be chosen to satisfy,
\begin{align}
  \bk{\de{x^\mu}}{\pa{\nu}} = \delta^\mu_\nu.
\end{align}

Clearly 1-forms lie on a vector space, $T^*_p M$, called the dual vector space or {\bf cotangent space}. As before, one defines the structure where 1-form fields live, as 
\begin{align}
  T^*M = \coprod_{p\in M} T^*_p M,
\end{align}
called {\bf cotangent bundle}, just like before, $\dim(T^*M)=2m$.

\subsection{Tensors}

Tensors are multi-linear objects, and they can be expressed in a ``vector basis'' given by the tensor product of basis of either $TM$ or $T^*M$. The tensor product is denoted by $\otimes$, and  it multiplies the basis of ``vector'' spaces in a way they transform independently. 

Tensors are said to be of type $\binom{p}{q}$ if it can be expanded in a basis containing the tensor product of $p$ times the basis of $T_xM$ and $q$ times the basis of $T_x^*M$, i.e.,  $\binom{p}{q}$-tensors lie on $\otimes^p T_x M\otimes^q T_X^*M$. Additionally, the rank of the tensor corresponds to the ``number of indices'', i.e., if $T\in \otimes^p T_x M\otimes^q T_x^*M$ its rank is $p+q$.

\begin{Ebox}
  How do the components of $T$ transform? Where 
  \begin{align}
    T= T^{a_1\cdots a_p}{}_{b_1\cdots b_q} \partial_{a_1}\otimes\partial_{a_p}\otimes dx^{b_1}\otimes dx^{b_q}.
  \end{align}
\end{Ebox}



\section{Induced Maps and Submanifolds}

Given a map, $f$, between two manifolds, $f:M\to N$, there are induced maps on all of the geometrical structures defined over them. Below, two important cases are considered, to know, the differential map and the pullback.

\subsection{Differential Map}

Let $f$ be a map from $M$ to $N$, $f:M\to N$. Then the differential map, 
\begin{align*}
  f_*:T_p M\to T_{f(p)}N,
\end{align*}
is such that,
\begin{align}
  \(f_* V\)[g] = V[g\circ f],
\end{align}
for $g$ a function on $N$

\subsection{Pullback Map}

\begin{Ebox}
  Let $M$, $N$ and $P$ be manifolds, and $ f:M\to N$, $g:N\to P$,  be maps between manifolds. 

  Show
  \begin{align*}
    (g\circ f)_* &= g_*\circ f_*\\
    (g\circ f)^* &= g^*\circ f^*
  \end{align*}
\end{Ebox}

\subsection{Submanifolds}

\section{Flows and Lie Derivative}

\begin{Ebox}
  For the example with $X=x\partial_y -y\partial_x$, show explicitly that 
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_t\circ \sigma_s = \sigma_{t+s}.
  \end{align}
\end{Ebox}


\begin{Ebox}
  Find the flow generated by
  \begin{align}
    X = x\partial_y +y\partial_x.
  \end{align}
\end{Ebox}

\begin{Ebox}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $X$ and $Y$ be vector fields on $M$ and $f:M\to\R$ a function.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate $\Li_{X}f$.
    \item Calculate $\Li_{fX}Y$.
    \item Calculate $\Li_{X}fY$.
    \end{itemize}
  \item  Let $X$ and $Y$ be vector fields on $M$ and $f:M\to N$ a map between manifolds. Show that
    \begin{align}
      f_*\comm{X}{Y} =\comm{f_*X}{f_*Y}.
    \end{align}
  \item Let $\omega\in\Lambda^1(M)$ be a one-form on $M$. Calculate
    \begin{align}
      \Li_X \omega
    \end{align}
  \end{itemize}
\end{Ebox}
